# 11 Express.js: Note Taker

My assignment was to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

```
AS A small business owner
I WANT to be able to write and save notes
SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete
```

## Output

The application can be found deployed on Heroku at: 
https://rocky-sea-75118.herokuapp.com/

## Reflections on the Project

While functionally very simple, the code base to make this progrma work is incredibly complex! It requires the use of Express.js, the generation of unique IDs for each note, and storage of all the notes created using a JSON file. It is also neccesary to create an account on Heroku, and deploy your application there as opposed to a fixed website like most of our last projects.
